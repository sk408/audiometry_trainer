discomfort.",category:e.EARMOLD},{id:"earmold-14",question:"What contraindication would most likely prohibit taking an ear impression?",options:["Mild hearing loss","Perforated tympanic membrane","Excessive ear hair","Previous hearing aid use"],correctOption:"b",explanation:"A perforated tympanic membrane is a major contraindication for taking an ear impression because impression material could enter the middle ear through the perforation, potentially causing serious complications and requiring surgical removal.",category:e.EARMOLD},{id:"earmold-15",question:"What is the primary purpose of a CROS or BiCROS earmold system?",options:["To amplify sounds for bilateral hearing loss","To reduce feedback in high-power hearing aids","To route sounds from the unaidable ear to the better ear","To improve directional hearing abilities"],correctOption:"c",explanation:"The primary purpose of a CROS or BiCROS earmold system is to route sounds from the unaidable ear (in CROS) or poorer hearing ear (in BiCROS) to the better ear, allowing the patient to be aware of sounds from both sides despite having one ear that cannot benefit from traditional amplification.",category:e.EARMOLD},{id:"earmold-16",question:"What is the most likely cause of acoustic feedback when using a custom earmold?",options:["Too large a vent","Poor fit allowing sound to leak between the earmold and ear canal","Use of incorrect tubing size","Earmold material is too soft"],correctOption:"b",explanation:"The most likely cause of acoustic feedback when using a custom earmold is a poor fit that allows amplified sound to leak between the earmold and ear canal, creating a pathway for sound to travel back to the microphone and cause feedback.",category:e.EARMOLD},{id:"earmold-17",question:"What is the primary benefit of a soft material for an earmold?",options:["Better retention","Improved frequency response","Enhanced comfort for the wearer","Reduced manufacturing cost"],correctOption:"c",explanation:"The primary benefit of a soft material for an earmold is enhanced comfort for the wearer, as soft materials conform better to the ear, create less pressure points, and feel more comfortable during extended wear, particularly important for new users or those with sensitive ears.",category:e.EARMOLD},{id:"earmold-18",question:"What earmold modification would most effectively reduce the occlusion effect while maintaining appropriate gain?",options:["Adding a helix lock","Using a longer canal portion","Adding an appropriate vent","Making the earmold out of harder material"],correctOption:"c",explanation:'Adding an appropriate vent would most effectively reduce the occlusion effect while maintaining appropriate gain, as the vent allows bone-conducted sound and low frequencies to escape, reducing the "plugged up" sensation while still allowing necessary amplification of other frequencies.',category:e.EARMOLD},{id:"earmold-19",question:"What is the primary purpose of a canal lock in an earmold design?",options:["To reduce feedback","To increase comfort","To improve retention","To enhance sound quality"],correctOption:"c",explanation:"The primary purpose of a canal lock in an earmold design is to improve retention by creating a slight bulge that sits at the second bend of the ear canal, preventing the earmold from working loose, especially important for patients with challenging ear anatomy or who lead active lifestyles.",category:e.EARMOLD},{id:"earmold-20",question:"What is the recommended approach for taking an ear impression on a child?",options:["Use exactly the same technique as for adults","Skip the otoscopic examination to avoid frightening the child","Have additional assistance to help keep the child still and use behavioral techniques to ensure cooperation","Take a partial impression to avoid
